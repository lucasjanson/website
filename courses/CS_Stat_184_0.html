              </p>
              <hr>

              <br> Modern AI systems often need the ability to make
              sequential decisions in an unknown, uncertain, possibly
              hostile environment, by actively interacting with the
              environment to collect relevant data. Reinforcement
              Learning (RL) is a general framework that can capture the
              interactive learning setting and has been used to design
              intelligent agents that achieve high-level performance in
              challenging applications such as Go, computer games,
              robotic manipulation, health care, and education. <br />

              <br> This course provides an introduction to reinforcement
              learning covering a range of problem formulations,
              algorithms, and theory. The four main themes of the course
              are <strong> (1) Markov decision processes (Bellman
                equations/optimality, planning, UCB, unknown environments,
                linear quadratic control, exploration, imitation
                learning), (2) bandits (epsilon-greedy, UCB, Thompson
                sampling, contextual bandits, linear bandits, exploration
                in MDPs), and (3) deep RL and methods for large-scale
                systems (policy gradient methods, Monte Carlo tree search,
                Q-learning, imitation learning). </strong><br />

              <br> There will also be an Embedded Ethics lecture on
              ethical issues arising in reinforcement learning. The
              assignments will focus on a mix of algorithmic and
              statistical principles, along with their programming
              implementations. <br />

              <br>After taking this course, students will be able to understand fundamental RL algorithms and their
              analysis. <br />

              <br><strong> The course will go through algorithms and
                their analysis. All homework will have a programming
                component to give students more hands-on experience with
                the concepts.</strong> <br />

                <br>Lectures will
                focus on algorithm design and analysis. We require a
                background in: calculus & linear algebra (e.g., AM22a, Math
                21b), probability theory (e.g., Stat 110), and programming
                in Python. The following topics are recommended but not
                required: linear regression, supervised learning,
                algorithms. <br />
                <br> Homeworks will
                have a programming component, and we expect students to be
                comfortable with programming in Python (or committed to
                quickly learning it). We will use Python as the programming language in all homeworks.<br />

                <br> <strong> Participation 5%; Homework
                  45% (HW0: 5%, HW1-HW4: 40% total);
                  Midterm 20%; Project 30%; </strong><br />

                <br> The course is letter-graded by default, but you may
                switch to SAT/UNSAT if you prefer. <br />

                <br> In order to pass the course, <strong> you must
                  attempt and submit all homework</strong>, even if they are
                submitted for zero credit (as per the late policy
                below). We will also have an "embedded ethics" lecture
                with 1-2 corresponding questions, either incorporated into
                a homework or as a standalone short assignment (with the
                grading scheme adjusted appropriately). All homeworks are
                mathematical and have a programming component (we use
                Python and <a href="https://gymnasium.farama.org/">Gymnasium</a>, formerly OpenAI
                Gym). <br />

                <br><strong>Participation: </strong> 5% of the grade will
                be participation. People can participate in the course in
                many different ways, including regular attendance of
                lectures (there will be a form after each class where
                students can record their attendance), participating in
                section, in the Ed forum, and more. At the end of the
                term, you will write a paragraph on how you participated
                in the course. The requirements to get the full 5%
                contribution will not be too onerous, and regularly
                attending the lectures will suffice. If for some reason
                you are not able to regularly attend all the lectures,
                then increased participation in Ed and section will be
                sufficient. If you have another responsibility that
                prevents you from attending all the lectures, please let
                us know by making a post that is "Private", i.e., "Visible to
                you and staff only" in Ed, and we will take this into
                consideration. <br />

                <br> <strong>Homework Policies: </strong>Collaboration is permitted
                though each student must understand, write, and hand in
                their own submission. In particular, it is acceptable for
                students to discuss problems with each other; it is not
                acceptable for students to look at another student's
                written answers. It is also not acceptable to publicly
                post your (even partial) solution on Ed, but it is
                encouraged for you to ask public questions on Ed. You
                must also indicate on each homework with whom you
                collaborated and what online resources you used. <br />

                <br> Each student will have <strong>96 cumulative hours
                </strong> of late time (as measured on Gradescope), which will
                be forgiven. After this cumulative amount of time has
                passed, any assignment that is turned in late will receive
                zero credit. Furthermore, only up to 48 hours of late time
                may be used on any one assignment; any assignment turned
                in more than 48 hours late will receive zero credit. You are expected to track your own late time. Your grades on gradescope will not reflect late time.
                <br />

                <br> The final homework score for HW1-4 will be
                determined by summing up the total points earned across
                all four assignments. This sum will then be divided by
                the total possible points to calculate the overall
                percentage score for the HW1-4 component of the
                course. <br />

                <br> We highly encourage you to use LaTeX. We will also
                accept neatly written handwritten homework. <br />

                <br> <strong>Homeworks must be submitted through <a
                    href="https://www.gradescope.com/courses/845617">Gradescope</a>. PDF
                  files of the homeworks can be accessed on Gradescope. PDF and LaTeX
                  files for the homeworks will also be uploaded to <a
                    href="https://canvas.harvard.edu/courses/140705/files/folder/Homeworks">Canvas</a>.</strong><br />




                <br><strong>Regrading Policy: </strong>
                All homework regrading requests must be submitted on Gradescope within
                seven days after the grades are released. For example,
                if we release the grades on Monday, then you have until midnight the
                following Monday to submit any regrade requests. If you feel that we
                have made an error in grading your homework, please let us know with a
                written explanation. This policy is to ensure that we can address any
                concerns in a timely and fair manner. The focus of office hours and in
                person discussions are solely limited to asking knowledge-related
                questions. Grade-related questions must be submitted by making a post
                that is "Private", i.e., "Visible to you and staff only" in Ed. <br />

              <!--
                <br><strong>Late days: </strong> Homeworks must be submitted by the posted due date. 
                  You are allowed up to 6 total LATE DAYs for the homeworks throughout the entire semester. These will be automatically deducted if your assignment is late. 
                  For example, any day in which an assignment is late by up to 24 hours, 
                  then one late day will be used (up to two late days). After your late days are used up, 
                  late penalties will be applied: any assignment turned in late will incur a reduction in score by 33% for each late day, 
                  so if an assignment is up to 24 hours late, it incurs a penalty of 33%. 
                  Else if it is up to 48 hours late, it incurs a penalty of 66%. 
                  And any longer, it will receive no credit. We will track all your late days and any deductions will be applied in computing the final grades. 
                  If you are unable to turn in HWs on time, aside from permitted days, then do not enroll in the course.<br/>

                While many academic disciplines have historically been dominated by one cross section of society,
                the study of and participation in STEM disciplines is a joy that the instructors hope that everyone can
                pursue,
                regardless of their socio-economic background, race, gender, etc.
                We encourage students to both be mindful of these issues, and,
                in good faith, try to take steps to fix them.
              </p>

                You should expect to be treated by your classmates and the course staff with respect.
                You belong here, and we are here to help you learn and enjoy this course.
                If any incident occurs that challenges this commitment to a supportive and inclusive environment,
                please let the instructors know so that the issue can be addressed. We are personally committed to this

              <p> Slides will be posted before each lecture, and
                annotated slides (with all notes taken on them by the
                instructor during lecture) will be posted after each
                lecture. We will make reasonable attempts to record and post
                each lecture. It is possible some lectures may not be recorded,
                in which case we will not be able to do any make-ups of that lecture. We
                encourage the students to attend the lectures in person (see the Participation Policy) and participate
                in the class discussion. </p>
              <p>
                Section materials will also be posted by the TFs. These
                materials serve as the reference material for the course
                content.

              <p>
                In addition to the lecture slides, there is also a draft textbook being written for this course,
                available <a href="https://rlbook.adzc.ai/">here</a>.
                This material should closely follow the lecture content, notation,
                and structure, with some additional material and examples (you are not responsible for the additional
                material and examples, though you will hopefully find them helpful).
                <strong>Feedback on any aspect of this draft is welcome and appreciated via the Ed forum.</strong>
